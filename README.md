# Regnerdetnu

This is hobby project for fun. Don't take anything in this repository seriously.

Live at RegnerDet.nu.

A site which checks whether it rains in your area. It is as simple as it sounds.

## Roadmap

### Finish website content
Right now the basic functionality works, but there is still some way to go. Need to finish content

### Azure function
In the near-future the retrival of weather info will be moved to an azure function, where it is possible to have a little more validation, caching and throttling.
